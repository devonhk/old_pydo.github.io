#Flask e-commerce webapp

*After trying wordpress, magento, opencart and many other e-commerce CMS applications
I decided to code my own custom solution.

#Indeed.ca job scrapers

[https://github.com/pydo/lead_scraper]()

*This is my original job scraper. It takes a search query and location parameter to find all matching
jobs. It will then scrape all jobs found and save them to a sqlite database.*

and the ORM version that uses SQLAlchemy

[https://github.com/pydo/lead_scraper_orm]()

*This version of the scraper is similar to the orignal but offers a few
improvements. I use an ORM (SQLAlchemy) for easier to read code and an easier
to user interface to search for jobs using argsparse.*

#CookServeDelicious image recognition bot

[https://github.com/pydo/cookServeDelicious-Bot]()

*This is an image recognition bot that uses histograms to currently identify
images and play the video game Cook Serve Delicious. The bot is fully automated
and plays the game without making any mistakes and playing much faster than
a human being ever could. I wrote this bot about 2 years ago so the original code
is a bit messy. It has been refactored a bit but isn't under active development.*
