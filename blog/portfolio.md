#Flask e-commerce webapp

*After trying wordpress, magento, opencart and many other e-commerce CMS applications
I decided to code my own custom solution.
My repository is currently private but I'll post a demo link to the site soon.*

#Django distance calculator

*This webapp started as a simple python script to calculate the distance between 2
locations using google's distance matrix API. I had a need for the tool when
I worked at an IT job that had me traveling all over the city. At the end of the
week I would go on googlemaps and type out all the addresses and copy the distances
into a spreadsheet. This was very repetitive and time consuming. So I wrote a simple
CLI application that had all the addresses I would have to visit. We used a simple
3 digit number to identify each location. So all I would have to do to get the distance
between 2 locations was type out 6 characters. During the 7 months that the contract lasted
it saved me hours of work. I realized that many people at the company disliked the time
consuming repetive task of going to googlemaps and typing out all the addresses manually.
I had solved the problem yet nobody would use my script. I realized quickly that
they were all scared of using CLI applications.

I believe the solution to this provide is to provide a simple graphic interface
with no software to install. So I wrote a simple webapp to do just that.*

#Indeed.ca job scrapers

[https://github.com/pydo/lead_scraper]()

*This is my original job scraper. It takes a search query and location parameter to find all matching
jobs. It will then scrape all jobs found and save them to a sqlite database.*

and the ORM version that uses SQLAlchemy

[https://github.com/pydo/lead_scraper_orm]()

*This version of the scraper is similar to the orignal but offers a few
improvements. I use an ORM (SQLAlchemy) for easier to read code and an easier
to user interface to search for jobs using argsparse.*

#CookServeDelicious image recognition bot

[https://github.com/pydo/cookServeDelicious-Bot]()

*This is an image recognition bot that uses histograms to currently identify
images and play the video game Cook Serve Delicious. The bot is fully automated
and plays the game without making any mistakes and playing much faster than
a human being ever could. I wrote this bot about 2 years ago so the original code
is a bit messy. It has been refactored a bit but isn't under active development.*
